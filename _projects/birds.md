Birding based out of Boulder, CO, most often at Confluence Ponds between class and work. Below is an assortment of bird photographs and drawings. Photos are taken using a Canon 5d Mark III with a 500mm f4.5 lens, occasionally with a 1.4x extender. Contributing to <a href="https://ebird.org/profile/NTgwMzc4MQ/world">eBird</a>.

I love to capture the resilience of winter birds as well:

And occasionally, some vagrants make their way into Boulder as well:
