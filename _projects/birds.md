Birding based out of Boulder, CO. Below is an assortment of bird photographs and drawings. Photos are taken using a Canon 5d Mark III with a 500mm f4.5 lens, occasionally with a 1.4x extender. Small collection of photos here, hundreds more on <a href="https://ebird.org/profile/NTgwMzc4MQ/world">eBird</a>, a citizen data science project developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

First, one of my favorite pictures in one of my favorite places on Earth.

Sparrows, the family Passerellidae, are one of the most overlooked groups of birds. If you look closely enough, they are each incredibly unique.

I love to capture the resilience of winter birds as well:

And occasionally, some vagrants make their way into Boulder:

In January 2025, I visited Hakaulau National Wildlife Refuge for birds and discovered much more... See <a href="https://cj-oneill.com/projects/ohiasar/">OhiaSAR</a>

The 'Akiapola'au pictured above is a key driver for me to pursue the O'hia project. This endemic's numbers are plummeting due to various factors with only a few hundred left in the wild.

And possibly my favorite capture, the Nene:
